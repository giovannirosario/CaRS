CaRS is a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in which the salesman travels in rented cars.  Given a graph G = (V,E) and a set of cars C, a weight corresponding to each car c∈C, is associated with each edge e∈E. Additionally, there is a square matrix, Γ = [γ(c,i,j)], of order n = |V|, in which each element γ(c,i,j) corresponds to the cost of renting car c in city i and return it in city j, i,j∈V, i ≠ j. The objective is to make a Hamiltonian tour in G with the minimum total cost, where the total cost is given by the sum of the weights associated to each edge of the tour plus the sum of the fees associated to matrix Γ.
